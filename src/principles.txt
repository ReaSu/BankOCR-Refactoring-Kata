Guiding principles (the "4 rules of simple design")


    1. Works and we can demonstrate that it works.
        (All tests pass. And exist.)


    2. Expresses developer intent.
        (Names are clear & stuff does one thing.)


    3. Does not contain duplication.
        (Knowledge is in one place.)


    4. Fewest number of moving parts.
        (Take out what you can without violating the first three.)







(Google them. Lots of interesting stuff.)
